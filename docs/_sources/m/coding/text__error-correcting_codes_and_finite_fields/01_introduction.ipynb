    "The theory of error-correcting codes deals with the general problem of transmitting messages reliably. (Transmission in space (wires) and in time (storage).) In the classical theory no assumption is made about the nature of the message to be transmitted. Thus there is no statistic on which to base a guess of the correct message. Redundancy is built into the message at the transmitter so that the receiver can use that redundancy to correct errors. This goal can be achieved with high probability but not with certainty. A weakness of the classical theory is that errors that occur before the transmitter encodes and transmits the message cannot be corrected much less detected."

Error-correcting codes like Hamming codes, Reed-Solomon codes, or modern low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are designed under the assumption that $p \\lt 1/2$. (Coin-flip analogy: If the coin has a bias such that heads occurs less than 50% of the time $(p \\lt 1/2)$, you can reasonably expect tails to occur more often than heads. If the bias were such that heads occurred more than 50% of the time $(p \\gt 1/2)$, you could redefine the \"success\" outcome as tails by reversing the interpretation, effectively flipping the probabilities.)\n",
