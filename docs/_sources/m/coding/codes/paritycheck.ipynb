    "Observe that the number of symbols plus thirty or so more for control codes amounts to less than $127 = 2^7 - 1$ or just $7$ bits. Thus the eighth bit of a byte can be used as a parity bit to check that the byte has been received without error. The eighth bit is set so that the number of $1$ s in the byte is even. This way, if a byte is transmitted and one of the bits goes wrong then the number of $1$ s becomes odd and the receiver can ask for a retransmission. There is no way the receiver can tell which bit went wrong, and if two bits are incorrect the receiver will let the byte through. In practice, the order of the bits is reversed so that the check bit comes first.\n",
