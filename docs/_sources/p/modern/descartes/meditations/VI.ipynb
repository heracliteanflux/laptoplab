    "And to be sure, from the fact that I sense a wide variety of colors, sounds, odors, tastes, levels of heat, and grades of roughness, and the like, I rightly conclude that in the bodies from which these different perceptions of the senses proceed there are differences corresponding to the different perceptions--though perhaps the latter do not resemble the former.\n",
    "\n",
    "And from the fact that some of these perceptions are pleasant while others are unpleasant, it is plainly certain that my bdy, or rather my whole self, insofar as I am composed of a body and a mind, can be affected by various beneficial and harmful bodies in the vicinity."

    "Granted, there are many other things that I seem to have been taught by nature; nevertheless it was not really nature that taught them to me but a certain habit of making reckless judgments.\n",
    "\n",
    "And thus it could easily happen that these judgmenets are false: for example, that any space where there is absolutely nothing happening to move my senses is empty; or that there is something in a hot body that bears an exact likeness to the idea of heat that is in me; or that in a white or green body there is the same whiteness or greenness that I sense; or that in a bitter or sweet body there is the same taste, and so on; or that stars and towers and any other distant bodies have the same size and shape that they present to my senses, and other things of this sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "But to ensure that my perceptions in this matter are suffciently distinct, I ought to define more precisely what exactly I mean when I say that I am \"taught something by nature.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For I am taking \"nature\" here more narrowly than the combination of everything bestowed on my by God.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this combination embraces many things that belong exclusively to my mind, such as my perceiving that what has been done cannot be undone, and everything else that is known by the light of nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is not what I am talking about here.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also many things that belong exclusively to the body, such as that it tends to move downward, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am not dealing with these either, but only with what God has bestowed on me insofar as I am composed of mind and body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, it is this nature that teaches me to avoid things that produce a sensation of pain and to pursue things that produce a sensation of pleasure, and the like.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it does not appear that nature teaches us to conclude anything, besides these things, from these sense perceptions unless the intellect has first conducted its own inquiry regarding things external to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "For it seems to belong exclusively to the mind, and not to the composite of mind and body, to know the truth in these matters.\n",

    "Thus, although a star affects my eye no more than does the flame from a small torch, still there is no real or positive tendency in my eye toward believing that the star is no larger than the flame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, ever since my youth, I have made this judgment without any reason for doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "And although I feel heat as I draw closer to the fire, and I also feel pain upon drawing too close to it, there is not a single argument that persuades me that there is something in the fire similar to that heat, any more than to that pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the contrary, I am convinced only that there is something in the fire that, regardless of what it finally turns out to be, causes in us those sensations of heat or pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "And although there may be nothing in a given space that moves the senses, it does not therefore follow that there is no body in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I see that in these and many other instances I have been in the habit of subverting the order of nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For admittedly I use perceptions of the senses (which are properly given by nature only for signifying to the mind what things are useful or harmful to the composite of which it is a part, and to that extent they are clear and distinct enough), as reliable rules for immediately discerning what is the essence of bodies located outside us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet they signify nothing about that except quite obscurely and confusedly."
