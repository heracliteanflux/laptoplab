    "This is so much the case that the will is the chief basis for my understanding that I bear a certain image and likeness of God.\n",
    "\n",
    "For although the faculty of willing is incomparably greater in God than it is in me, both by virtue of the knowledge and power that are joined to it and that render it more resolute and efficacious and by virtue of its object inasmuch as the divine will stretches over a greater number of things, nevertheless, when viewed in itself formally and precisely, God's faculty of willing does not appear to be any greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is owing to the fact that willing is merely a matter of being able to do or not do the same thing, that is, of being able to affirm or deny, to pursue or to shun; or better still, the will consists solely in the fact that when something is proposed to us by our intellect either to affirm or deny, to pursue or to shun, we are moved in such a way that we sense that we are determined to it by no external force.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be free I need not be capable of being moved in each direction; on the contrary, the more I am inclined toward one direction--either because I clearly understand that there is in it an aspect of the good and the true, or because God has thus disposed the inner recesses of my thought--the more freely do I choose that direction.\n",

    "Were I always to see clearly what is true and good, I would never deliberate about what is to be judged or chosen.\n",
