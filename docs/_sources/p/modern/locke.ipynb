    "RATIONALIST DEFENSE OF INNATISM\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationalists muster the argument from universal consent (UC) in defense of the assertion that since the set of logical principles (S) are universally assented to by all mankind they are therefore innate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In B1C2-3, Locke challenges the necessity or proof of UC by conjecturing its coincidentality: the argument from UC would hold if it could be proved that innatism was the one and only reason for UC; on the other hand, UC will fail to hold if it could be shown that there was some alternative to innatism which could be shown to be the reason for any observed UC.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, Locke suggests that there is such an alternative but moves on to the simpler refutation of UC, which lay in the falsity of the second premise, or in the evidence or observation that in fact S is not assented to by all of mankind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Locke takes the two Leibnizian principles of identity and contradiction as paradigm and representative of all propositions which could be said to be innate so that no such proposition holds up as innate if these two do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "THE FALSITY OF P, EVIDENCE FOR NO UC\n",
    "\n",
    "In B1C2-5 [pp 349], Locke sets out to argue that there is a portion of mankind that does not assent to S, that portion designated by Locke's children and idiots. For Locke, it's clear that children and idiots do not apprehend nor think. It's not clear that this so obvious now, but we could assume that by children and idiots are meant newborns and individuals who have become mentally incapacitated for one reason or another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Locke via Modus Tollens\n",
    "If S is imprinted on the mind/soul, then S is apprehended/perceived/thought/understood by the mind/soul<br>\n",
    "S is not apprehended/perceived/thought/understood by the mind/soul of M<br>\n",
    "Therefore, S is not imprinted on the mind/soul of M<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "LOCKE: \"If therefore children and idiots have souls, have minds, with those impressions upon them, they must unavoidably perceive them, and necessarily know and assent to these truths. Since they do not, it is evident that there are no such impressions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Locke further solidifies the necessary relation between the notion of innatism to that of his definition of imprinting in terms of being apprehended/perceived/understood:\n",
    "\n",
    "LOCKE: \"For if they are not notions naturally imprinted, how can they be innate? And if they are notions imprinted, how can they be unknown?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "No proposition can be both [imprinted] in the mind/soul while being unknown to the mind/soul. If some proposition can be both [imprinted] in the mind/soul (i.e., innate) while being unknown to the mind/soul, then the proposition is capable of being known to the mind/soul; and the mind/soul is capable of assenting to all truths it will ever know. Therefore, all such truths can be said to be innate.\n",
    "\n",
    "LOCKE: \"No proposition can be said to be in the mind which it never yet knew...For if any one may, then, by the same reason, all propositions that are true, and the mind is capable ever of assenting to, may be said to be in the mind and to be imprinted; since, if any one can be said to be in the mind, which it never yet knew, it must be only because it is capable of knowing it; and so the mind is capable of all truths it ever shall know.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Locke briefly attacks the blanket argument that if the mind comes to the use of reason then the ideas known to the mind are innate with the observation that irrational minds often employ the use of reason in their justification of unreasonable conclusions.\n",
