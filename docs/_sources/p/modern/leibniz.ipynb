    "1. On divine perfection, and that God does everything in the most desirable way.\n",
    "    * The most widely accepted and meaningful notion we have of God is expressed well enough in these words, that God is an absolutely perfect being; yet the consequences of these words are not sufficiently considered.\n",
    "    * And, to penetrate more deeply into this matter, it is appropriate to remark that there are several entirely different perfections in nature, that God possesses all of them together, and that each of them belongs to him in the highest degree.\n",
    "    * We must also know what a perfection is.\n",
    "    * A fairly sure test for being a perfection is that forms or natures that are not capable of a highest degree are not perfections, as for example, the nature of number or figure.\n",
    "    * For the greatest of all numbers (or even the number of all numbers), as well as the greatest of all figures, imply a contradiction, but the greatest knowledge and omnipotence do not involve any impossibility.\n",
    "    * Consequently, power and knowledge are perfections, and, insofar as they belong to God, they do not have limits.\n",
    "    * Whence it follows that God, possessing supreme and infinite wisdom, acts in the most perfect manner, not only metaphysically, but also morally speaking, and that, with respect to ourselves, we can say that the more enlightened and informed we are about God's works, the more we will be disposed to find them excellent and in complete conformity with what we might have desired.\n",
    "2. Against those who claim that there is no goodness in God's works, or that the rules of goodness and beauty are arbitrary.\n",
    "    * Thus I am far removed from the opinion of those who maintain that there are no rules of goodness and perfection in the nature of things or in the ideas God has of them and who say that the works of God are good solely for the formal reason that God has made them.\n",
    "    * For, if this were so, God, knowing that he is their author, would not have had to consider them afterwards and find them good, as is testified by the Sacred Scriptures--which seem to have used such anthropomorphic expressions only to make us understand that the excellence of God's works can be recognized by considering them in themselves, even when we do not reflect on this empty external denomination which relates them to their cause.\n",
    "    * This is all the more true, since it is by considering his works that we can discover the creator.\n",
    "    * His works must therefore carry his mark in themselves.\n",
    "    * I confess that the contrary opinion seems to me extremely dangerous and very near to the opinion of the recent innovators who hold that the beauty of the universe and the goodness we attribute to the works of God are but the chimeras of those who conceive of God in terms of themselves.\n",
    "    * Thus, in saying that things are not good by virtue of any rule of goodness but solely by virtue of the will of God, it seems to me that we unknowingly destroy all of God's love and all his glory.\n",
    "    * For why praise him for what he has done if he would be equally praiseworthy in doing the exact contrary?\n",
    "    * Where will his justice and wisdom reside if there remains only a certain despotic power, if will holds the place of reason, and if, according to the definition of tyrants, justice consists in whatever pleases the most powerful?\n",
    "    * Besides, it seems that all acts of will presuppose a reason for willing and that this reason is naturally prior to the act of will.\n",
    "    * That is why I also find completely strange the expression of some other philosophers who say that the eternal truths of metaphysics and geometry and consequently also the rules of goodness, justice, and perfection are merely the effects of the will of God; instead, it seems to me, they are only the consequences of his understanding, which, assuredly, does not depend on his will, any more than does his essence.\n",
    "3. Against those who believe that God might have made things better.\n",
    "    * Nor can I approve of the opinion of some moderns who maintain boldly that what God has made is not of the highest perfection and that he could have done much better.\n",
    "    * For it seems to me that the consequences of this opinion are wholly contrary to the glory of God: As a lesser evil is relatively good, so a lesser good is relatively evil.\n",
    "    * And to act with less perfection than one could have is to act imperfectly.\n",
    "    * To show that an architect could have done better is to find fault with this work.\n",
    "    * This opinion is also contrary to the Sacred Scripture, which assures us of the goodness of God's works.\n",
    "    * For, if their view were sufficient, then since the series of imperfections descends to infinity, God's works would always have been good in comparison with those less perfect, no matter how he created them, but something is hardly praiseworthy if it can be praised only in this way.\n",
    "    * I also believe that a great many passages from Sacred Scripture and the holy fathers will be found favoring my opinion, but scarcely any will be found favoring the opinion of these moderns, an opinion which is, in my judgment, unknown to all antiquity and which is based only on the inadequate knowledge we have of the general harmony of the universe and of the hidden reasons for God's conduct.\n",
    "    * This enables us to judge audaciously that many things could have been rendered better.\n",
    "    * Besides, these moderns insist on certain dubious subtleties, for they imagine that nothing is so perfect that there is not something more perfect--this is an error.\n",
    "    * They also believe that in this way they are able to safeguard God's freedom, as though it were not freedom of the highest sort to act in perfection following sovereign reason.\n",
    "    * For to believe that God does something without having any reason for his will--overlooking the fact that his seems impossible--is an opinion that conforms little to his glory.\n",
    "    * Let us assume, for example, that God chooses between A and B and that he takes A without having any reason to prefer it to B.\n",
    "    * I say that this action of God is at the very least not praiseworthy; for all praise must be based on some reason, and by hypothesis there is none here.\n",
    "    * Instead I hold that God does nothing for which he does not deserve to be glorified.\n",
    "4. That the love of God requires our complete satisfaction and acquiescence with respect to what he has done without our being quietists as a result.\n",
    "    * The general knowledge of this great truth, that God acts always in the most perfect and desirable way possible, is, in my judgment, the foundation of the love that we owe God in all things, since he who loves seeks his satisfaction in the happiness or perfection of the object loved and in his actions.\n",
    "    * To will the same and dislike the same is true friendship.\n",
    "    * And I believe that it is difficult to love God well when we are not disposed to will what God wills, when we might have the power to change it.\n",
    "    * In fact, those who are not satisfied with what God does seem to me like dissatisfied subjects whose attitudes are not much different from those of rebels.\n",
    "    * I hold, therefore, that, according to these principles, in order to act in accordance with the love of God, it is not sufficient to force ourselves to be patient; rather, we must truly be satisfied with everything that has come to us according to his will.\n",
    "    * I mean this acquiescence with respect to the past.\n",
    "    * As for the future, we must not be quietists and stand ridiculously with arms folded, awaiting that which God will do, according to the sophism that the ancients called logon aergon, the lazy reason.\n",
    "    * But we must act in accordance with what we presume to be the will of God, insofar as we can judge it, trying with all our might to contribute to the general good and especially to the embellishment and perfection of that which affects us or that which is near us, that which is, so to speak, in our grasp.\n",
    "    * For although the outcome might perhaps demonstrate that God did not wish our good will to have effect at present, it does not follow that he did not wish us to act as we have.\n",
    "    * On the contrary, since he is the best of all masters, he never demands more than the right intention, and it is for him to know the proper hour and place for letting the good designs succeed.\n",
    "5. What the rules of the perfection of divine conduct consist in, and that the simplicity of the ways is in balance with the richness of the effects.\n",
    "    * Therefore, it is sufficient to have the confidence that God does everything for the best and that nothing can harm those who love him.\n",
    "    * But to know in detail the reasons that could have moved him to choose this order of the universe--to allow sins, to dispense his saving grace in a certain way--surpasses the power of a finite mind, especially when it has not yet attained the enjoyment of the vision of God.\n",
    "    * However, we can make some general remarks concerning the course of providence in the governance of things.\n",
    "    * We can therefore say that one who acts perfectly is similar to an excellent geometer who can find the best constructions for a problem; or to a good architect who makes use of his location and the funds set aside for a building in the most advantageous manner, allowing nothing improper or lacking in the beauty of which it is capable, or to a good householder, who makes use of his holdings in such a way that there remains nothing uncultivated and sterile; or to a skilled machinist who produces his work in the least difficult way possible; or to a learned author who includes the greatest number of thruths in the smallest possible volume.\n",
    "    * Now, the most perfect of all beings, those that occupy the least volume, that is, those that least interfere with one another, are minds, whose perfections consist in their virtues.\n",
    "    * That is why we mustn't doubt that the happiness of minds is the principal aim of God and that he puts this into practice to the extent that general harmony permits is.\n",
    "    * We shall say more about this below.\n",
    "6. God does nothing which is not orderly and it is not even possible to imagine events that are not regular.\n",
    "    * The volitions or acts of God are commonly divided into ordinary or extraordinary.\n",
    "    * But it is good to consider that God does nothing which is not orderly.\n",
    "    * Thus, what passes for extraordinary is extraordinary only with some particular order established among creatures; for everything is in conformity with respect to the universal order.\n",
    "    * This is true to such an extent that not only does nothing completely irregular occur in the world, but we would not even be able to imagine such a thing.\n",
    "    * Thus, let us assume, for example, that someone jots down a number of points at random on a piece of paper, as do those who practice the ridiculous art of geomancy.\n",
    "    * I maintain that it is possible to find a geometric line whose notion is constant and uniform, following a certain rule, such that this line passes through all the points in the same order in which the hand jotted them down.\n",
    "    * And if someone traced a continuous line which is sometimes straight, sometimes circular, and sometimes of another nature, it is possible to find a notion, or rule, or equation common to all the points of this line, in virtue of which these very changes must occur.\n",
    "    * For example, there is no face whose contours are not part of a geometric line and cannot be traced in one stroke by a certain regular movement.\n",
    "    * But, when a rule is extremely complex, what is in conformity with it passes for irregular.\n",
    "    * Thus, one can say, in whatever manner God might have created the world, it would always have been regular and in accordance with a certain general order.\n",
    "    * But God has chosen the most perfect world, that is, the one which is at the same time the simplest in hypotheses and the richest in phenomena, as might be a line in geometry whose construction is easy and whose properties and effects are extremely remarkable and widespread.\n",
    "    * I use these comparisons to sketch an imperfect likeness of divine wisdom and to point out something that can at least elevate our minds to conceive in some way what cannot be sufficiently expressed.\n",
    "    * But I do not claim to explain in this way the great mystery upon which the entire universe depends.\n",
    "7. That miracles conform to the general order, even though they may be contrary to the subordinate maxims; and about what God wills or permits by a general or particular volition.\n",
    "    * Now, since nothing can happen which is not in the order, one can say that miracles are as much within the order as are natural operations, operations which are called natural because they are in conformity with certain subordinate maxims that we call the nature of things.\n",
    "    * For one can say that this nature is only God's custom, with which he can dispense for any stronger reason than the one which moved him to make use of these maxims.\n",
    "    * As for the general or particular volitions, depending on how the matter is understood, we can say that God does everything following his most general will, which is in conformity with the most perfect order he has chosen, but we can also say that he has particular volitions which are exceptions to these aforementioned subordinate maxims.\n",
    "    * For the most general of God's laws, the one that rules the whole course of the universe, is without exception.\n",
    "    * We can also say that God wills everything that is an object of his particular volition.\n",
    "    * But we must make a distinction with respect to the objects of his general volition, such as the actions of other creatures, particularly the actions of those that are reasonable, actions with which God wishes to concur.\n",
    "    * For, if the action is good in itself, we can say that God wills it and sometimes commands it, even when it does not take place.\n",
    "    * But if the action is evil in itself and becomes good only by accident, because the course of things (particularly punishment and atonement) corrects its evilness and repays the evil with interest in such a way that in the end there is more perfection in the whole sequence than if the evil had not occurred, then we must say that God permits this but does not will it, even though he concurs with it because of the laws of nature he has established and because he knows how to draw a greater good from it.\n",
    "8. To distinguish the actions of God from those of creatures we explain the notion of an individual substance.\n",
    "9. That each singular substance expresses the whole universe in its own way, and that all its events, together with all their circumstances and the whole sequence of external things, are included in its notion.\n",
    "10. That the belief in substantial forms has some basis, but that these forms do not change anything in the phenomena and must not be used to explain particular effects.\n",
    "11. That the thoughts of the theologians and philosophers who are called Scholastics are not entirely to be disdained.\n",
    "12. That the notions involved in extension contain something imaginary and cannot constitute the substance of body."
