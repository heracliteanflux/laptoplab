    "Moral philosophy, or the science of human nature, may be treated after two different manners, each of which has its peculiar merit and may contribute to the entertainment, instruction, and reformation of mankind.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST SPECIES:\n",
    "\n",
    "The one considers man chiefly as born for action and as influenced in his measures by taste and sentiment, pursuing one object and avoiding another according to the value which these objects seem to possess and according to the light in which they present themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "As virtue, of all objects, is allowed to be the most valuable, this species of philosophers paint her in the most amiable colors, borrowing all help from poetry and eloquence and treating their subjuect in an easy and obvious manner, and such as is best fitted to please the imagination and engage the affections.\n",
    "\n",
    "They select the most striking observations and instances from common life, place opposite characters in a proper constrast, and, alluring us into the paths of virtue by the views of glory and happiness, direct our steps in these paths by the soundest precepts and most illustrious examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "They make us feel the difference between vice and virtue; they excite and regulate our sentiments; and so they can but bend our hearts to the love of probity and true honor, they think, that they have fully attained the end of all their labors.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND SPECIES\n",
    "* consider man in light of a reasonable being\n",
    "* endeavor to form his understanding\n",
    "* human nature, a subject of speculation\n",
    "* WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THE DISTINCTIONS between truth and falsehood, vice and virtue, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other species of philosophers consider man in the light of a reasonable rather than an active being and endeavor to form his understanding more than cultivate his manners.\n",
    "\n",
    "They regard human nature as a subject of speculation and, with a narrow scrutiny, examine it in order to find those principles which regulate our understanding, excite our sentiments, and make us approve or blame any particular object, action, or behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "They think it a reproach to all literature that philosophy should not yet have fixed, beyond controversy, the foundation of morals, reasoning, and criticism, and should forever talk of truth and falsehood, vice and virtue, beauty and deformity, without being able to determine the source of these distinctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "While they attempt this arduous task, they are deterred by no difficulties; but proceeding from particular instances to general principles, they still push on their inquiries to principles more general and rest not satisfied until they arrive at those original principles by which, in every science, all human curiosity must be bounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though their speculations seem abstract and even unintelligible to common readers, they aim at the approbation of the learned and the wise and think themselves sufficiently compensated for the labor of their whole lives, if they can discover some hidden truths which may contribute to the instruction of posterity.\n",
    "\n",
    "P\n",
    "\n",
    "It is certain that the easy and obvious philosophy will always, with the generality of mankind, have the preference above the accurate and abstruse, and by many will be recommended not only as more agreeable, but more useful than the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "It enters more into common life, molds the heart and affections, and, by touching those principles which actuate men, reforms the their conduct and brings them nearer to that model of perfection which it describes.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the contrary, the abstruse philosophy, being founded on a turn of mind which cannot enter into business and action, vanishes when the philosopher leaves the shade and comes into open day, nor can its principles easily retain any influence over our conduct and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feelings of our heart, the agitation of our passions, the vehemence of our affections, dissipate all its conclusions and reduce the profound philosopher to a mere plebeian.\n",
    "\n",
    "P\n",
    "\n",
    "This also must be confessed that the most durable as well as the most just fame has been acquired by the easy philosophy and that abstract reasoners seem up to now to have enjoyed only a momentary reputation from the caprice or ignorance of their own age, but have not been able to support their renown with more equitable posterity.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy for a profound philosopher to commit a mistake in his subtle reasonings; and one mistake is the necessary parent of another, while he pushes on his consequences and is not deterred from embracing any conclusion by its unusual appearance or its contradiction to popular opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a philosopher whose only purpose is to represent the common sense of mankind in more beautiful and more engaging colors, if by accident he falls into error, goes no further, but, renewing his appeal to common sense and the natural sentiments of the mind, returns into the right path and secures himself from any dangerous illusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fame of Cicero flourishes at present, but that of Aristotle is utterly decayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "La Bruy√®re passes the seas and still maintains his reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the glory of Malebranche is confined to his own nation and to his own age.\n",
    "\n",
    "And Addison, perhaps, will be read with pleasure when Locke shall be entirely forgotten.\n",
    "\n",
    "P\n",
    "\n",
    "There mere philosopher is a character which is commonly but little acceptable in the world, as being supposed to contribute nothing to either the advantage of the pleasure of society, while he lives remote from communication with mankind and is wrapped up in principles and notions equally remote from their comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the mere ignorant is still more despised, nor is anything deemed a surer sign of an illiberal genius in an age and nation where the sciences flourish than to be entirely destitute of all relish for those noble entertainments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most perfect character is supposed to lie between those extremes: retaining an equal ability and taste for books, company, and business; preserving in conversation that discernment and delicacy which arise from polite letters, and in business that probity and accuracy which are the natural result of a just philosophy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to diffuse and cultivate so accomplished a character, nothing can be more useful than compositions of the easy style and manner which do not draw too much from life, require no deep application or retreat to be comprehended, and send back the student among mankind full of noble sentiments and wise precepts applicable to every exigency of human life.\n",
    "\n",
    "By means of such compositions virtue becomes amiable, science agreeable, company instructive, and retirement entertaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "P\n",
    "\n",
    "Man is a reasonable being and, as such, receives from science his proper food and nourishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "But so narrow are the bounds of human understanding that little satisfaction can be hoped for in this particular, from either the extent or the security of his acquisitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Man is a sociable no less than a reasonable being.\n",
    "\n",
    "But neither can he always enjoy company agreeable and amusing nor can he preserve the proper relish for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Man is also an active being and, from that disposition, as well as from the various necessities of human life, must submit to business and occupation.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the mind requires some relaxation and cannot always support its bent to care and industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems, then, that nature has pointed out a mixed kind of life as most suitable to the human race and secretly admonished them to allow none of these biases to draw too much, so as to incapacitate them for other occupations and entertainments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indulge your passion for science, she says, but let your science be human and such as may have a direct reference to action and society.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstruse thought and profound researches I prohibit and will severely punish by the pensive melancholy which they introduce, by the endless uncertainty in which they involve you and by the cold reception which your pretended discoveries shall meet with, when communicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be a philosopher, but, amid all your philosophy, be still a man.\n",
    "\n",
    "P     THERE ARE SOME THINGS WORTH SAVING!\n",
    "\n",
    "Were the generality of mankind contented to prefer the easy philosophy to the abstract and profound, without throwing any blame or contempt on the latter, it might not be improper, perhaps, to comply with this general opinion and allow every man to enjoy, without opposition, his own taste and sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as the matter is often carried further, even to the absolute rejecting of all profound reasonings, or what is commonly called metaphysics, we shall now proceed to consider what can reasonably be pleaded in their behalf.\n",
    "\n",
    "P     ACCURACY IS ADVANTAGEOUS\n",
    "\n",
    "We may begin with observing that one considerable advantage which results from the accurate and abstract philosophy is its subservience to the easy and humane, which, without the former, can never attain a sufficient degree of exactness in its sentiments, precepts, or reasonings.\n",
    "\n",
    "All polite letters are nothing but pictures of human life in various attitudes and situations, and inspire us with different sentiments of praise or blame, admiration or ridicule, according to the qualities of the object which they set before us.\n",
    "\n",
    "An artist must be better qualified to succeed in this undertaking who, besides a delicate taste and a quick apprehension, possesses an accurate knowledge of the internal fabric, the operations of the understanding, the workings of the passions, and the various species of sentiment which discriminate vice and virtue.\n",
    "\n",
    "However painful this inward search or inquiry may appear, it becomes in some measure requisite to those who would describe with success the obvious and outward appearances of life and manners.\n",
    "\n",
    "The anatomist presents to the eye the most hideous and disagreeable objects, but his science is useful to the painter in delineating even a Venus or a Helen.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the latter employs all the richest colors of his art and gives his figures the most graceful and engaging airs, he must still carry his attention to the inward structure of the human body, the position of the muscles, the fabric of the bones, and the use and figure of every part or organ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy is, in every case, advantageous to beauty, and just reasoning to delicate sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In vain would we exalt the one by depreciating the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "P\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, we may observe, in every art or profession, even those which most concern life or action, that a spirit of accuracy, however acquired, carries all of them nearer their perfection and renders them more subservient to the interests of society.\n",
    "\n",
    "And though a philosopher may live remote from business, the genius of philosophy, if carefully cultivated by several, must gradually diffuse itself throughout the whole society and bestow a similar correctness on every art and calling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The politician will acquire greater foresight and subtlety in the subdividing and balancing of power, the lawyer more method and finer principles in his reasonings, and the general more regularity in his discipline and more caution in his plans and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stability of modern governments above the ancient and the accuracy of modern philosophy have improved, and probably will still improve, by similar gradations.\n",
    "\n",
    "P\n",
    "\n",
    "Were there no advantage to be reaped from these studies beyond the gratification of an innocent curiosity, yet ought not even this be despised as being one accession to those few safe and harmless pleasures which are bestowed on human race.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sweetest and most inoffensive path of life leads through the avenues of science and learning; and whoever can either remove any obstructions in this way or open up any new prospect ought so far to be esteemed a benefactor to mankind.\n",
    "\n",
    "And though these researches may appear painful and fatiguing, it is with some minds as with some bodies, which, being endowed with vigorous and florid health, require severe exercise, and reap a pleasure from what, to the generality of mankind, may seem burdensome and laborious.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obscurity, indeed, is painful to the mind as well as to the eye, but to bring light from obscurity, by whatever labor, must necessarily be delightful and rejoicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "P\n",
    "\n",
    "But this obscurity in the profound and abstract philosophy is objected to, not only as painful and fatiguing, but as the inevitable source of uncertainty and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here indeed lies the most just and most plausible objection against a considerable part of metaphysics that they are not properly a science, but arise either from the fruitless efforts of human vanity, which would penetrate into subjects utterly inaccessible to the understanding, or from the craft of popular superstitions, which, being unable to defend themselves on fair ground, raise these entangling brambles to cover and protect their weakness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chased from the open country, these robbers fly into the forest and lie in wait to break in upon every unguarded avenue of the mind and overwhelm it with religious fears and prejudices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stoutest antagonist, if he remits his watch a moment, is oppressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "And many, through cowardice and folly, open the gates to the enemies and willingly receive them with reverence and submission as their legal sovereigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "P\n",
    "\n",
    "But is this a sufficient reason why philosophers should desist from such researches and leave superstition still in possession of her retreat?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it not proper to draw an opposite conclusion and perceive the necessity of carrying the war into the most secret recesses of the enemy?\n",
    "\n",
    "In vain do we hope that men, from frequent disappointment, will at last abandon such airy sciences and discover the proper province of human reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "For, besides the fact that many persons find too sensible an interest in perpetually recalling such topics--besides this, I say, the motive of blind despair can never reasonably have place in the sciences, since, however unsuccessful former attempts may have proved, there is still room to hope that the industry, good fortune, or improved sagacity of succeeding generations may reach discoveries unknown to former ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each adventurous genius will still leap at the ardurous prize and find himself stimulated, rather than discouraged by the failures of his predecessors, while he hopes that the glory of achievement so hard an adventure is reserved for him alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only method of freeing learning at once from these abstruse questions is to inquire seriously into the nature of human understanding and show, from an exact analysis of its powers and capacity, that it is by no means fitted for such remote and abstruse subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must submit to this fatigue in order to live at ease ever after and must cultivate true metaphysics with some care in order to destroy the false and adulterate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indolence, which to some person affords a safeguard against this deceitful philosophy, is, with others, overbalanced by curiosity; and despair, which at some moments prevails, may give place afterwards to sanguine hopes and expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurate and just reasoning is the only catholic remedy fitted for all persons and all dispositions and is alone able to subvert that abstruse philosophy and metaphysical jargon which, being mixed up with popular superstition, renders it in a manner impenetrable to careless reasoners and gives it the air of science and wisdom.\n",
    "\n",
    "P\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides this advantage of rejecting, after deliberate inquiry, the most uncertain and disagreeable part of learning, there are many positive advantages which result from an accurate scrutiny into the powers and faculties of human nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is remarkable concerning the operations of the mind that, though most intimately present to us, yet, whenever they become the object of reflection, they seem involved in obscurity, nor can the eye readily find those lines and boundaries which discriminate and distinguish them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objects are too fine to remain long in the same aspect or situation and must be apprehended in an instant by a superior penetration derived from nature and improved by habit and reflection.\n",
    "\n",
    "It becomes, therefore, no inconsiderable part of science barely to know the different operations of the mind, to separate them from each other, to class them under their proper heads, and to correct all that seeming disorder in which they lie involved when made the object of reflection and inquiry.\n",
    "\n",
    "This task of ordering and distinguishing, which has no merit when performed with regard to external bodies, the objects of our senses, rises in its value when directed towards the operations of the mind in proportion to the difficulty and labor which we meet with in performing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we can go no further than this mental geography or delineation of the distinct parts and powers of the mind, it is at least a satisfaction to go so far; and the more obvious this science may appear (and it is by no means obvious), the more contemptible still must the ignorance of it be esteemed in all pretenders to learning and philosophy.\n",
    "\n",
    "P\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor can there remain any suspicion that this science is uncertain and chimerical, unless we should entertain such a skepticism as is entirely subversive of all speculation and even action.\n",
    "\n",
    "It cannot be doubted that the mind is endowed with several powers and faculties, that these powers are distinct from each other, that what is really distinct to immediate perception may be distinguished be reflection, and consequently that there is a truth and falsehood in all propositions on this subject, and a truth and falsehood which does not lie beyond the compass of human understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many obvious distinctions of this kind"
