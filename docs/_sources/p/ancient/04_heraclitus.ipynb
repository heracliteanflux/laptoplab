    "This fragment by Heraclitus is often interpreted as a commentary on the nature of perception and human understanding.\n",
    "<br><br>\"Men are deceived in the recognition of what is obvious\": This suggests that people often fail to understand or grasp things that are apparent or evident. It implies that despite the presence of obvious truths or realities, humans may still be deceived or misguided in their perceptions.\n",
    "<br><br>\"Like Homer who was wisest of all the Greeks\": Heraclitus refers to the poet Homer, renowned for his epic works like the Iliad and the Odyssey, who was considered the wisest among the Greeks. However, even Homer, the epitome of wisdom, was subject to deception.\n",
    "<br><br>\"For he was deceived by boys killing lice, who said: what we see and catch we leave behind; what we neither see nor catch we carry away\": This particular example provided by Heraclitus involves boys killing lice. The boys claim that they leave behind what they see and catch (the lice), but they carry away what they neither see nor catch (the remaining lice). This statement reflects a paradoxical situation.\n",
    "<br><br>The interpretation of this fragment varies, but it generally suggests that people can be deceived by focusing on immediate and tangible aspects while overlooking more profound or hidden truths. It underscores the limitation of relying solely on sensory perception and encourages a deeper understanding of the world beyond what is immediately visible.\n",
    "<br><br>Heraclitus may be highlighting the need to look beyond the surface and consider the underlying principles and causes that govern reality. This fragment aligns with Heraclitus' overall philosophical outlook, which emphasized the constant flux and interconnectedness of the universe and the importance of understanding the underlying unity amidst apparent diversity.\n",

    "<br><br>\"Pythagoras son of Mnesarchus pursued inquiry further than all other men\": This part acknowledges Pythagoras' exceptional dedication to intellectual inquiry and exploration. It suggests that Pythagoras went beyond the achievements of other individuals in his pursuit of knowledge.\n",
    "<br><br>\"Choosing what he liked from these compositions, made a wisdom of his own\": This phrase implies that Pythagoras drew from various sources and philosophical traditions, selecting and integrating elements that resonated with him. He formulated his own unique wisdom by synthesizing these diverse influences.\n",
    "<br><br>\"Much learning, artful knavery\": This concluding statement is open to interpretation and can be understood in different ways. One possible interpretation is that Pythagoras' wisdom was characterized by a combination of extensive knowledge (\"much learning\") and clever or cunning manipulation (\"artful knavery\"). This suggests that Pythagoras possessed not only intellectual depth but also strategic or manipulative skills in promoting his ideas.\n",
    "<br><br>Another interpretation is that \"artful knavery\" is used metaphorically to describe Pythagoras' ability to navigate the complexities of philosophical and intellectual pursuits. It suggests that he was skillful in presenting and defending his ideas, employing rhetoric and persuasion to further his philosophical goals.\n",
    "<br><br>Overall, this fragment highlights Pythagoras' exceptional intellectual pursuits, his ability to forge his own wisdom from diverse sources, and possibly acknowledges his resourcefulness or persuasive tactics. It offers insight into the complexity and depth of Pythagoras' philosophical approach. \n",

Heraclitus asserts that among all the accounts he has heard, none has reached the level of recognizing what is genuinely wise. This implies that he has encountered many opinions and philosophies but has not encountered a comprehensive understanding of true wisdom that sets it apart from all other perspectives.\n",
    "<br><br>This fragment can be interpreted as Heraclitus expressing his dissatisfaction with the prevailing accounts or explanations of wisdom that he has come across. It suggests that he believes true wisdom is a rare and elusive quality, not easily attained or comprehended by most individuals.\n",
    "<br><br>Heraclitus' philosophical approach often emphasized the importance of deep insight and understanding of the underlying principles governing the universe. It is likely that he sought a profound understanding of wisdom that transcended conventional knowledge and superficial explanations.\n",
