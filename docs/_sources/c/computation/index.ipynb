    "* \"A computer is a silicon device...that does not metabolize, it's something completely different. So it's entirely arbitrary to project our own conscious inner life on a computer. It does not have any tenable empirical basis. Can I with certainty discard that hypothesis that a computer can become conscious in and of itself? I cannot. But I cannot with certainty discard the hypothesis that there is a teapot in the orbit of Saturn. I cannot discard with certainty the hypothesis of the flying spaghetti monster. There are a great many things that are nonsensical and that I cannot with certainty refute. That's not the important question. The important question is what do we have reasons to belive. Do we have reasons to believe that a silicon computer is conscious in and of itself? I would say none. Computers simulate consciousness. But you see, I can simulate kidney function on my computer right now accurately down to the molecular level. That doesn't mean my computer will pee on my desk because a simulation is not the thing simulated. So when people say if I simulate human intelligence in a computer then the computer is conscious, what you are saying is that if you simulate kidney function then the computer will pee on your desk. It's just...arbitrary and frankly absurd.\" Russell Brand. (July 26, 2022). \"Hang On, Could AI Do THIS?!\". [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8lNC9n-YAc)."
