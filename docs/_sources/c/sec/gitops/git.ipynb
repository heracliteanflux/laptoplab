    "* the new commit will have the same changes and message but a different SHA (because the SHA is based on more than just the changes: it includes information about the commit that precedes it)\n",
    "* can cherry-pick commits from any branch including remote-tracking branches\n",
    "* cannot cherry-pick a merge commit because it does not contain the set of changes to apply, it's connecting a set of commits\n",
    "* can result in conflicts that must be resolved just like merge conflicts\n",
    "* cherry-picking a commit is applying an existing set of changes to the current branch (these changes may conflict with the current state of the branch)\n",
    "\n",
    "Diff patches\n",
    "* allow us to share changes via files instead of a remote repo\n",
    "* useful when changes are not ready for a public branch\n",
    "* useful when collaborators do not share a remote with us\n",
    "* patches are used during discussion, review, or the approval process\n",
    "* applying a diff patch applies the changes in a diff patch file to the working directory (it makes the changes but does not automatically commit them)\n",
    "* a diff patch only contains the set of changes, not the commit history (like cherry-picking does)\n",
    "\n",
    "Formatted patches\n",
    "* exports of commits in the Unix mailbox format\n",
    "* useful for email distribution of changes\n",
    "* includes commit messages and some metadata\n",
    "* puts each commit in a separate file by default\n",
    "* applying formatted patches extracts the author, commit message, and changes from a mailbox message and applies them to the current branch as commits\n",
    "* similar to cherry-picking commits: get the same changes and commit messages, but different SHAs (the commit history is transferred)\n",
    "\n",
    "Rebase commits\n",
    "* take commits from a branch and replay them at another point, most often at the end of another branch (giving the commits a new base or starting points)\n",
    "* useful to integrate recent commits without merging\n",
    "* maintains a cleaner, more linear project history\n",
    "* rebasing during development ensures topic or feature branch commits apply cleanly back to the main branch\n",
    "* if we're working with collaborators, it forces each one to take responsibility for resolving merge conflicts while they're developing\n",
    "* some teams require rebasing before a feature branch can be considered for the main branch\n",
    "* the commit message and the metadata is kept, but the SHAs change because the previous commit in the chain has changed (it doesn't just shift the changes, but reapplies them in order)\n",
    "* rebasing commits may conflit with existing code\n",
    "* when a conflict occurs, git pauses the rebase before each conflicting commit (similar to resolving merge and cherry-pick conflicts)\n",
    "\n",
    "merging vs rebasing\n",
    "* two ways to incorporate changes from one branch into another branch\n",
    "* similar ends but different means\n",
    "* side effects!\n",
    "* merging: adds a merge commit; nondestructive; complete record of what happened and when; easy to undo; logs can become cluttered and nonlinear\n",
    "* rebasing: no additional merge commits (cleaner); destructive (SHA changes, commits are rewritten, rewriting history); no longer a complete record of what happened and when; tricky to undo; logs are cleaner and more linear\n",
    "* golden rule of rebasing: thou shalt not rebase a public branch (rebasing is destructive; do not rebase branches that others use); rebase abandons existing shared commits and creates new similar commits instead; collaborators would see project history vanish\n",
    "* merge to allow commits to stand out or to be clearly grouped\n",
    "* merge to bring large topic branches back into main\n",
    "* rebase to add minor commits in main to an in-progress topic branch: keeps it current and keeps the history cleaner\n",
    "* rebase to move commits from one branch to another\n",
    "* merge anytime the topic branch is already public and being used by others (the golden rule of rebasing)\n",
    "\n",
    "interactive rebasing\n",
    "* modify commits as they are being replayed\n",
    "* instead of rebasing the commits immediately, opens the git-rebase-todo file for editing (can reorder, skip commits, edit commit contents)\n",
    "* pick (use) commit, drop (don't use) commit, reword commit message, edit contents of change set, squash, fixup, exec (runs from command line shell)\n",
    "* squashing commits folds two or more commits into one\n",
    "* squash: combine changesets, edit and concatenate commit messages\n",
    "* fixup: combine changesets, discards commit messages and keeps the prior message\n",
    "* uses the first author in the commit series\n",
    "\n",
    "pull rebase\n",
    "* pull usually fetches from a remote repo to remote-tracking branch and merges with local code\n",
    "* pull rebase fetches from the remote and then rebases the current branch to tip of remote-tracking branch instead of merging\n",
    "* pull rebase keeps history cleaner by reducing merge commits\n",
    "* only rebase on local commits not shared to a remote\n",
    "\n",
    "log options\n",
    "* log is the primary interface to git: the purpose of git is to track changes over time and the log lists those changes\n",
    "* many options: sorting, filtering, output formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "blame\n",
    "* browse annotated version of files\n",
    "* determine who changed which lines in a file and why\n",
    "* useful for probing the history behind a file's contents\n",
    "* useful for identifying which commit introduced a bug\n",
    "\n",
    "bisect\n",
    "* find the commit that introduced a bug or regression: when did things go wrong?\n",
    "* useful when there's a problem in the code and we know that there was a time in the past when the problem didn't exist\n",
    "* tell git the last time we know when the code was working and the first time we know it's not working (i.e., mark the last good revision and the first bad revision)\n",
    "* bisect resets the code to the midpoint between the good and bad versions and lets you test it: mark as good or bad version, and repeat"
