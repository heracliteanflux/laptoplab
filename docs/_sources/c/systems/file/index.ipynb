    "What is a __[file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system)__?\n",
    "\n",
    "The file system is made up of resources such as __[files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file)__ and __[folders (directories)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing))__. Folders can contain both folders and files. Files contain neither files nor folders. If a directory `x` contains a directory `y` then we say that `x` is the __parent__ of `y`. The file system is like an upside-down tree with the root directory at the top of the tree and branches of nested folders terminating in files and empty folders--the leaves of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are always in _some_ directory in the filesystem. This directory is called the __[working directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "An __absolute path__ (to some resource) is the path (to that resource) _relative to the root directory_.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __relative path__ (to some resource) is the path (to that resource) _relative to the working directory_."
