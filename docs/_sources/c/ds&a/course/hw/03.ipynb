    "1\\. In the previous assignment you were asked to consider various approaches for the $k$-way merge problem: creating a single sorted array efficiently out of $k$ sorted arrays, each containing $n$ elements. One approach considered involved examining the head of each of the $k$ arrays to identify the next largest element, and placing this into the output array. This resulted in an operation that had a cost of $O(k^2n)$. Given the content discussed in this module, can you propose an algorithm that uses this same basic approach, but runs in $O(kn \\log k)$ instead? State the algorithm and prove its complexity. Additionally, prove a statement of the lower bound (i.e., big-omega) of its space complexity, accounting for both $k$ and $n$ (i.e., $S(n, k)$)."
