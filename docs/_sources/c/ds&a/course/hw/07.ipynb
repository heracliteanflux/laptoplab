    "You are placed in charge of the development of an algorithm for the newly created Penn State University Missile Defense System, which is responsible for defending the university from missile attacks launched from the University of Pennsylvania. Fortunately, your life has been made a bit easier by a defector, who has provided you with the full schedule of planned missile launches over the next $n$ days. For each day $i \\lt n$, $x_i$ missiles will arrive. Because of the defector, you know the exact values of $x_i$.\n",

    "Unfortunately due to budget cuts, your missile defense system has limited capacity. You need to stockpile anti-missile munitions which are supplied to you each day. Additionally, when the missile defense system is activated it will expend all available munitions regardless of the number of missiles destroyed that day. Munitions are supplied according to a function $f(j)$ such that the value of this function indicates the number of missiles that can be intercepted by the system after $j$ days of stockpiling. If the system is activated after $j$ days of stockpiling, on day $k$, then it will destroy $\\min\\{ x_k, f(j) \\}$ incoming missiles.\n",

You must also analyze the runtime of this algorithm and state its time complexity in big-theta notation."
