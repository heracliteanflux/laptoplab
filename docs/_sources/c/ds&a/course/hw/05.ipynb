Dijkstra's algorithm begins by prioritizing $v_1$, the vertex with the smallest weight, and proceeds as normal along subsequent nonnegative edges. Since the weight of the outgoing edge to $v_1$ is smaller than the weights of any other outgoing edge, there is no path from $s$ to $v_1$ with a better path weight than the weight of the outgoing edge to $v_1$ itself.  And in general, for each $v_i, v_j$ such that $i \\lt j$ there is no path from $s$ to $v_i$ through $v_j$ with a better path weight than the weight of the outgoing edge to $v_i$ itself.
