    "Quickselect is based on the idea of using a partial quicksort instead of a partial selection sort on the naive selection algorithm which finds the $k$-th minimum element. Like quicksort, quickselect uses a partition function to select a pivot element and swap lesser elements to the left of it and greater elements to the right of it."

    "When the array consists of a single element the element is the smallest element which is returned by the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inductive step\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the algorithm is correct for all $1 \\le n \\lt x$. It must be shown that the algorithm is correct for $n = x$. Depending on the choice of pivot there are three cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. the $k$-th element is in the left sub array\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the size of the left sub array must be larger than $k$, and that the $k$-th element of the whole array is the same as the $k$-th element of the left sub array. The size of the left sub array must be less than $x$ (this must be true even in the worst case because the largest possible value for the size of the left sub array is $x - 1$; the pivot itself is not included in either sub array so each call to partition will reduce the total size of the sub arrays by at least $1$). By the inductive hypothesis, the algorithm is correct for all arrays of size $n \\lt x$ and therefore the algorithm will be correct for finding the $k$-th element of the sub array. Thus the algorithm is correct in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. the $k$-th element is the pivot\n",
    "\n",
    "This case is trivial. The partition function ensures that the pivot element is in its appropriate sorted order. Thus if the pivot is equal to $k$ we have found the $k$-th element and returned it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. the $k$-th element is in the right sub array\n",
    "\n",
    "This case is similar to the case of the left sub array. If the $k$-th element is in the right sub array then this is analogous to calling quickselect on the right sub array (which will be correct due to the inductive hypothesis). However, the $k$ value will need to be different here as the $k$-th element in the entire array is actually the $(k - \\ell - 1)$-th element of the right sub array where $\\ell$ is the size of the left sub array. The detail is handled implicitly by the algorithm described above because of the $\\text{pivot} + 1$ starting offset in the recursive call to quickselect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we've proven the base case and proven that if the algorithm is correct for all array sizes up to $x$ it is also correct for an array size $x$ and so correctness has been show by induction on $x$."
