    "1\\. The $k$-th smallest element will be the element at index $k$ in an array that is sorted in ascending order. Sort the array in $\\Theta(n \\log n)$ time and then lookup the $k$-th element. This approach does some unnecessary work. We don't need the entire array to be sorted, just the first $k$ elements. For example, if we had an array of $1000$ elements and we wanted to find the third smallest one, following this approach we would spend a lot of time sorting irrelevant elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. An improved approach sorts only the necessary elements and follows from the observation that finding the minimum element in the array can be thought of as a special case of the selection problem where $k = 0$. In this case a simple linear time algorithm can be expressed as follows.\n",
